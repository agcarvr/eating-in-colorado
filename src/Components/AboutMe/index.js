        <h2>A little about Erin Carver</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Erin Carver. I am a software engineer and I enjoy refining my food palette so I made this site! I am still a bit new to Colorado so I thought a blog would be a great way to get to know the restaraunts of the area</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include photography, competitive gaming, and fashion. I enjoy expressing myself through many other medium as well! My favorite cuisine genres are Italian and Japanese food. I love pasta but I still enjoy all other types of food and love to try new things.</p>
        <p>If you have a colorado restaraunt you would like me to review please feel free to email "agcarvr@gmail.com" about it and I would love to find new restaraunts!</p>
